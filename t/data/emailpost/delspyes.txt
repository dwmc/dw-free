<li/> Started game night. It feels like it has been longer but it was  
only one year ago that I started doing the board game /card game  
thing at my house once a month. A year later we have a hundred people  
on the mailing list, the event regularly has 30 or more people  
attending. Its fun
<li/> <A HREF="http://krow.livejournal.com/393408.html">Went to  
Australia</A>. Attended the Linux Conference there, which was one of  
the best conferences I have been to in years. Stayed with Arjen and  
Greg.
<LI/> Launched <A HREF="http://planetasterisk.org/">Planet Asterisk</A>.

<A HREF="http://krow.livejournal.com/2006/02/">Feb</A>
<li/> Started hunting down <A HREF="http://krow.livejournal.com/ 
400869.html">Blue Tooth viruses</A> and reading up on them.
<li/> Went to <A HREF="http://krow.livejournal.com/ 
403909.html">Mashup Camp</A>.

<A HREF="http://krow.livejournal.com/2006/03/">March</A>
<li/> Posted about <A HREF="http://krow.livejournal.com/ 
407733.html">recharging laptops off the bathroom power</A>. I've been  
getting hilarious photos ever since from others. Somewhere in iPhoto  
is the picture of the guy who ran the orange power cord back to his  
seat. He had a power strip for others to share.
<li/> I got to see <A HREF="http://krow.livejournal.com/ 
409338.html">Mt Vasuveus</A> during a Sun Rise. Incredible site. One  
of the prettiest mountains I have seen.
<li/> Learned about <A HREF="http://krow.livejournal.com/ 
413808.html">Adam Bosworth's Six F's</A>. This has been a really  
wonderful tool to use to apply in learning about my own focus and the  
focus of other's.

<A HREF="http://krow.livejournal.com/2006/04/">April</A>
<li/> Started playing with <A HREF="http://krow.livejournal.com/ 
415389.html">NAS solutions</A>.
<li/> <A HREF="http://krow.livejournal.com/419138.html">MySQL's User  
Conference</A>. Got to see Linden Lab's describe their architecture.  
It is neat, but its not the future (the future is federated  
services... Linden Lab is similar to AOL/Prodigy/Compuserve; HTTP was  
the federated information system which was ubiquitious).

<A HREF="http://krow.livejournal.com/2006/05/">May</A>
<li/> Tim O'Reilly brought up the topic of <A HREF="http:// 
radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/05/ 
brian_aker_of_mysql_responds.html">"Database War Stories"</A>. I  
still think that there is a place for <A HREF="http:// 
krow.livejournal.com/421577.html">meta data which can be queried in a  
structured format</A>. But blobs? Less and less do I believe they  
have any business being in databases, and more and more I believe  
that something closer to HTTP like grammar makes more sense.
<li/> Went to my eighth year of <A HREF="http://krow.livejournal.com/ 
425894.html">Folklife</A>
<li/> Started my practice of always going for walks on Sunday. I  
don't always do this, but I do it most of the time.
<li/> Tweaked my roll at MySQL. I only tend to stay at companies for  
three years or so, and this has been good for me.

<A HREF="http://krow.livejournal.com/2006/06/">June</A>
<li/> <A HREF="http://krow.livejournal.com/427018.html">Panel  
discussion</A> in Boston on Open Source Business Models. This was  
with Miguel de Icaza from Novell, and Mike Olsen from SleepyCat/ 
Oracle. Stephen Walli set it up.
<li/> Spoke at <A HREF="http://krow.livejournal.com/ 
427916.html">LinuxWorld</A> in Korea.
<li/> Went to the Summer Solstice Parade in Freemont.

<A HREF="http://krow.livejournal.com/2006/07/">July</A>
<li/> Started the <A HREF="http://krow.livejournal.com/ 
434338.html">Genesis</A> articles. I never finished this writing  
project but it got me into thinking about the problem domain in new  
ways.
<li/>New <A HREF="http://krow.livejournal.com/436692.html">Julian  
photo</A>. Have I mentioned lately Julian is one of the most filled  
with life people I have met?
<li/> Party at <A HREF="http://krow.livejournal.com/ 
438599.html">OSCON</A>.

<A HREF="http://krow.livejournal.com/2006/08/">August</A>
<li/> Played with <A HREF="http://krow.livejournal.com/ 
442461.html">S3</A> a bit to see what it was all about.
<li/> Started tossing out concepts for new <A HREF="http:// 
krow.livejournal.com/443675.html">Engine designs</A> for MySQL
<li/> First release of the <A HREF="http://hg.tangent.org/ 
memcache_engine">memcache storage engine</A> for MySQL.

<A HREF="http://krow.livejournal.com/2006/09/">September</A>
<li/> <A HREF="http://krow.livejournal.com/446256.html">Yellow  
Jackets</A> invade the alley. The mailman still hates me.
<li/>  <A HREF="http://krow.livejournal.com/450890.html">EC2</A>  
response to <A HREF="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2006/09/ 
amazon_ec2_mysq.html">Jeff Barr</A>.

<A HREF="http://krow.livejournal.com/2006/10/">October</A>
<li/> Trixbox <A HREF="http://krow.livejournal.com/ 
451870.html">acquisition</A> by Fonality. It shows how quickly the  
focus of where open source can shift and that in the end  
distributions are still king.
<li/> I confront the <A HREF="http://krow.livejournal.com/ 
453660.html">War on Moisturizer</A>.
<li/> <A HREF="http://krow.livejournal.com/454477.html">Breakfast</A>  
with Ace and Eric in Amsterdam

<A HREF="http://krow.livejournal.com/2006/11/">November</A>
<li/> <A HREF="http://krow.livejournal.com/456700.html">MySQL Camp</ 
A>.  The Friday and Saturday morning were my favorite parts.  
Listening to the Zmanda folks describe backups was really neat since  
it meant someone is actually readying the design documents we publish!
<li/> <A HREF="http://krow.livejournal.com/459865.html">Concrete!</A>  
The return of having a hot tub again :)

<A HREF="http://krow.livejournal.com/2006/12/">December</A>
<li/> Finally got around to playing with <A HREF="http:// 
krow.livejournal.com/467425.html">One Wire</A>. This solves a few  
pieces of the puzzle for 2007 projects around the house.
<li/> More <A HREF="http://krow.livejournal.com/467425.html">DD-WRT</ 
A>. This is the first year I have really gotten into watching what  
the communities around embedding Linux in application devices are  
doing. rPath is another project that has sparked my interest in the  
last month.
<li/> <A HREF="http://blip.tv/file/115874">Ignite Seattle</A>.  As  
much as I do different community activities I don't invest nearly as  
much as I would like in the technical community in Seattle. I need to  
work on changing this.

On the technology front I notice a few themes. A need for NAS at  
home, more application focused Hardware, and while Google is great I  
found myself more interested in what Amazon was doing this year.

Traveling? I can't tell if I traveled more or less this year. I  
certainly racked up my frequent flyer miles though.

On a personal note I have "space" which feels more like mine. This is  
good for me.

Health? I ate more like a Vegan this year then in any previous. I  
doubt I will become a vegan, traveling would just about make this  
impossible for me, but I like the trend I see in my diet. I have also  
done a lot more walking this year (and met one great walking partner  
too!).

2005 was a lousy year for me writing software, 2006 was a complete  
change. Wrote more, picked up better habits in writing code this year  
(far more test cases, better use of revision control systems...), etc...

Blogging? I wrote more this year. Heavy on the technology side, not  
as strong on the personal accounts of the world around me.

There will be a post later on about resolutions and tasks for the  
next year (Will he finally get around to creating an Audio blog? Will  
he kick all of the constructions crews out of his house? Will he get  
a new puppy? Will he find Nirvana in NAS? Will <A HREF="http:// 
exploitseattle.com/">ExploitSeattle</A> finally get rebooted? And how  
about that Crawler project?).
