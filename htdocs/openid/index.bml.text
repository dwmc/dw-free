(You don't need the http:// part, either).  For example,  enter <b>username.[[domain]]</b>, replacing <b>username</b> with your own username.  After you do so, you'll be sent to [[sitename]] briefly to ask if you want to trust that site to know who you are.  You can either trust them once or forever.  You can change your <a href="/openid/options.bml">OpenID settings and trust</a> at any time.
