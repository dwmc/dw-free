S1 allowed people who knew HTML to somewhat easily re-style their journal but had a number of shortcomings:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The four views (recent (&quot;lastn&quot;), friends, calendar, and day) all had to be created independently and couldn't share any code. So if you wanted to make a new style you had to do it four times. The tediousness of this made us reluctant to add any more views to the system (such as a month view or single item/comments view).
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="circle"><li>Styles weren't easily customizable, and thus not well-suited for the majority of users. While there existed the idea of &quot;color themes&quot;, they were ill-designed in that it was assumed any color theme should be able to plug into any style. The available colors to set (by the themes) and use (by the styles) were named things like &quot;background&quot;, &quot;foreground&quot;, &quot;weak accent&quot;, &quot;text on weak accent&quot;, &quot;strong accent&quot;, etc.. Unfortunately, no color theme worked well with every layout and no layout worked well with all color theme. In S2, color themes are specific to the layout.</li><li>Colors were the only things that were easily customizable. Other options required editing HTML or doing CSS, both things which the average user neither knows nor should know.</li></ul></div></li><li>S1 didn't give style authors much flexibility, since it didn't offer any way to do conditional output. Instead, the system itself has to anticipate author needs and conditionally populate and provide certain template blocks, depending on whether there's, say, an entry subject or not. S2, on the other hand, is a full programming langauge, so authors can do whatever they want.</li></ul></div><p>S2 addresses all these problems. But fear not: S1 will stick around for those who prefer it and/or those who don't want to make the jump to S2 just yet. But we believe we'll win everybody over eventually once they give it a shot.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="about.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="intro.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="design.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">1. About S2 </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 3. Design Goals</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
