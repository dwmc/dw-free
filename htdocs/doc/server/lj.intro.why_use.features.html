<p>A <span class="application">LiveJournal</span> installation comes with many configurable features available
      &#8220;<span class="quote">out of the box</span>&#8221;, including but not limited to:</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<p class="title"><b>Journal related</b></p>
<dl>
<dt><span class="term">Journaling service</span></dt>
<dd>
<span class="application">LiveJournal</span>'s core function. Users are able to submit journal
            entries and &#8220;<span class="quote">publish</span>&#8221; them on their account's journal page.</dd>
<dt><span class="term">Community journals</span></dt>
<dd>Journals that many users can post top-level entries to. This allows
            for more long-term and public discussion than comments in a user's journal.</dd>
<dt><span class="term">Friends list aggregation</span></dt>
<dd>Users are able to add other users to their &#8220;<span class="quote">Friends list</span>&#8221;, which
            lets them view all journal entries from their friends in an aggregate form.</dd>
<dt><span class="term">Friends filters</span></dt>
<dd>Users can view a subset of their Friends lists at any given time. 
        By setting up a filter containing all their subscribed syndicated accounts, 
        a user can use their Friends list as an online <acronym class="acronym">RSS</acronym>/Atom aggregator.</dd>
<dt><span class="term">Calendar view</span></dt>
<dd>Users can see a record of all of their posts in the past, and
            choose to view those posts by a specific day, month, or year (allowing easy access to old posts).</dd>
<dt><span class="term">Message boards</span></dt>
<dd>Users can enable or disable commenting for individual
            entries or journals as a whole. Users can choose to allow anybody,
            registered users only, or only friends to post. Users can choose to
            &#8220;<span class="quote">screen</span>&#8221; comments &#8212; make them visible 
            only to the owner of the journal &#8212; and choose to set certain levels 
            of comments to be automatically screened until approved 
            (such as a user choosing to screen all comments by
            non-friends until they decide to approve them).</dd>
<dt><span class="term">E-mail notification of comments</span></dt>
<dd>Users can choose to receive an <span class="application">e-mail</span>
            notification when someone comments on one of their entries (in the user's
            personal journal or in a community journal) or replies to one of their
            comments (in the user's personal journal, a friend's journal, or a
            community journal).</dd>
<dt><span class="term">Security levels</span></dt>
<dd>Users can specify who can read their journal entries.
            Entries can be public (all can read), private (only the user can read),
            protected (only the user's named &#8220;<span class="quote">friends</span>&#8221; can read), or custom. 
            Custom security allows a user to specify up to 30 subgroups of their friends who
            can read the entries.</dd>
<dt><span class="term"><acronym class="acronym">RSS</acronym> and Atom feeds</span></dt>
<dd>Your installation publishes all public journal content as both 
        <acronym class="acronym">RSS</acronym> and Atom feeds for syndication on other sites. <span class="application">LiveJournal</span> 
        allows users to syndicate external <acronym class="acronym">RSS</acronym> and Atom feeds 
        onto <span class="application">LiveJournal</span>, to read on users' Friends page.</dd>
<dt><span class="term">Content in a rich variety of formats</span></dt>
<dd>As well as publishing entries in <acronym class="acronym">RSS</acronym>/Atom formats, your 
        installation publishes various account metadata in an <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym>-based format. 
        These include <acronym class="acronym">OPML</acronym> feeds listing subscribed syndicated feed accounts, 
        an Atom feed listing userpics updated to an account, 
        contact information in vCard and <acronym class="acronym">FOAF</acronym> 
        format, and more.</dd>
<dt><span class="term">Tagging</span></dt>
<dd>Users can tag entries into categories, allowing browsing filtered by tag 
        or syndication of entries in <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym> format by selected tags.</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">Moods, </span><span class="term">mood icons</span>
</dt>
<dd>Each entry can be given a &#8220;<span class="quote">mood</span>&#8221;, to
            describe what the user is feeling at that time. Users can choose to add a
            &#8220;<span class="quote">mood icon</span>&#8221;, which is a small picture to depict that mood. Users can
            create their own &#8220;<span class="quote">mood icon</span>&#8221; themes for use in their journal.</dd>
<dt><span class="term">Polls</span></dt>

            represent the user throughout the site. Users can re-format (e.g. crop/resize) pictures 
            as they upload them, using the <acronym class="acronym">AJAX</acronym>-based 
            &#8220;<span class="quote">Userpic Factory</span>&#8221; to meet requirements.</dd>
<dt><span class="term">Personalized subdomain</span></dt>
<dd>If configured, users can view their journals at
            <code class="uri"><em class="replaceable"><code>http://username.domain.com</code></em></code>, as well as
            <code class="uri"><em class="replaceable"><code>http://www.domain.com/users/username</code></em></code> and
            <code class="uri"><em class="replaceable"><code>http://www.domain.com/~username.</code></em></code>  
            Site administrators can elect to use subdomains only, on a per-site basis.</dd>
<dt><span class="term">Customizing the display of the journal page</span></dt>
<dd>Users can create journal &#8220;<span class="quote">styles</span>&#8221; from scratch and have
            precise control over appearance of their journals.</dd>
<dt><span class="term">Friends of Friends feature</span></dt>
<dd>Users are able to see a list of entries by
            the users who are named as a friend by their friends, but not by
            the user. Users can filter this to display entries by 
            account type(s) &#8212; personal journals, syndicated accounts, etc.</dd>
<dt><span class="term">E-mail posting</span></dt>
<dd>Post by <span class="application">e-mail</span>, optionally using

<dt><span class="term">Downloadable clients</span></dt>
<dd>Users can download a program to make journal entries
            (and perform some other actions on the site) from their computer, rather
            than from the website.</dd>
<dt><span class="term">Tell a Friend</span></dt>
<dd>With one click on the &#8220;<span class="quote">read entry</span>&#8221; page, users can send an
            <span class="application">e-mail</span> to someone else about an entry, calling the recipient's attention to
            it.</dd>
<dt><span class="term">Export feature</span></dt>
<dd>Users can download their journal month-by-month, in <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym> or
            <acronym class="acronym">CSV</acronym> format.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="variablelist">
<p class="title"><b>Account related</b></p>
<dl>
<dt><span class="term">User bio</span></dt>
<dd>Users can provide information about themselves, which is
            displayed on a profile page that can be viewed by visitors to their journal (the
            &#8220;<span class="quote">user bio</span>&#8221;). Users can enter contact and location information (<span class="application">e-mail</span>,
            AIM username, Yahoo! ID, Google Talk Address, Skype ID, MSN Messenger username, Jabber address,
            city, state, country, etc) and specify the security level of that
            information (public, private, protected).</dd>
<dt><span class="term">Site search</span></dt>
<dd>Users can search by contact information &#8212; finding other
            users by <span class="application">e-mail</span> address, AIM username, Yahoo ID, Google Talk Address, Skype ID, MSN Messenger
            username, Jabber address etc., &#8212; to locate people on your installation.</dd>
<dt><span class="term">Interests</span></dt>
<dd>Users can list up to 150 one to four-word interests in their
            user bio, which other users can search for.</dd>
<dt><span class="term">Similar interest search</span></dt>
<dd>If configured, users can see a list of those users whose
            interests match most closely to their own, based on an index that weights
            both number of interests in common and rarity of interests in common.</dd>
<dt><span class="term">Popular with Friends search</span></dt>
<dd>The ability to see a list of the users who
            are named most often as a friend by the user's friends, but not by the
            user.</dd>
<dt><span class="term">Domain forwarding</span></dt>
<dd>Users can forward their domain/subdomain to their <span class="application">LiveJournal</span> blog (so that, for example, 
        <code class="uri"><em class="replaceable"><code>http://www.example.org</code></em></code> would
            forward to the user's <span class="application">LiveJournal</span> 
            at <code class="uri">http://<em class="replaceable"><code>username.domain.com</code></em></code>)</dd>
<dt><span class="term">Journal embedding</span></dt>
<dd>Users can &#8220;<span class="quote">embed</span>&#8221; their journal into their home pages,
            displaying their journal as part of an external home page. (This is
            different from domain forwarding; with domain forwarding, the content is
            served from the <span class="application">LiveJournal</span> installation; with embedding, the content is first pulled
            onto the user's server and then re-presented.)</dd>
<dt><span class="term">Text messaging</span></dt>
<dd>Users can specify their text message information and
            display an option on their user bio page to allow others to text message
            them. (This allows users to receive text messages without having to make
            their information public.)</dd>
<dt><span class="term">Memory list</span></dt>
<dd>Users can mark any post on the service as a &#8220;<span class="quote">memory</span>&#8221; &#8212; a <span class="application">LiveJournal</span>
            version of bookmarking. Memories can be categorized with different
            keywords and security settings, so that users can more easily sort their memories.</dd>
<dt><span class="term">To-do list</span></dt>
<dd>Users can create their own &#8220;<span class="quote">to-do</span>&#8221; list &#8212; reminders of
            important things to do &#8212; and track percentage complete and progress on
            each item.</dd>
<dt><span class="term">Birthday list</span></dt>
<dd>Users can see a list of all of their friends with
            an upcoming birthday (assuming the user has provided his or her birthday).</dd>

<dl>
<dt><span class="term">Directory</span></dt>

            referenced in journal entries site-wide. Users can also check to see where
            those <acronym class="acronym">URL</acronym>s are being referenced. (By some slight alteration, users can
            also see if anyone on your installation is linking to a specific <acronym class="acronym">URL</acronym>, and where.)</dd>
<dt><span class="term">Random feature</span></dt>
<dd>Users can view a random journal from a subset of users who
            have updated in the past 24 hours.</dd>
<dt><span class="term">Notification of Events and Updates (&#8220;<span class="quote"><code class="systemitem"><acronym class="acronym">ESN</acronym></code></span>&#8221;)</span></dt>
<dd>Users can subscribe to events like when an entry is updated or receives new comments. 
        Users can opt to receive notifications by <span class="application">e-mail</span> or in an on-site message center when the event occurs.</dd>
<dt><span class="term"><span class="trademark">OpenID</span>&#8482; Support</span></dt>
<dd>
<span class="trademark">OpenID</span>&#8482; integration allowing commenting by users of other systems.</dd>

            page as the update page.</dd>
