<P><B>Grammar</B>
<BR>Think of this like a DOS or <tt>bash</tt> prompt.  The first word is a command.  Every word after that is an argument to that command.  Every command has a different number of required and optional parameters.  White space delimits arguments.  If you need a space in an argument, put double quotes around the whole thing.  If you need double quotes and spaces in an argument, escape the quote with a backslash (\) first.  If you need to do a backslash, escape that with a backslash.
<P>It's pretty straight-forward.  If you're confused, ask.

<P><B>Command Reference</B>
<BR>Arguments in &lt;angle brackets&gt; are required.  Arguments in [brackets] are optional.  If there is more than one optional argument, you can't skip one and provide one after it.  Once you skip one, you have to skip the rest.
