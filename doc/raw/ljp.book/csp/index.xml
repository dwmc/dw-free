      There are a few types of interfaces available to the &lj;
      protocol: the older <quote>flat</quote> interface, the custom &xmlrpc; interface, 
      Atom &api; support, and a modified version of the Blogger &api;.
      The &xmlrpc; interface is probably easiest to use, because there are lots of &xmlrpc;
      resources available to developers in just about any programming language. If
      you are in a situation that requires you to write your own interface wrapper,
      the flat interface is probably best to use.

        Internally, all interfaces are just wrappers around the same functions.  Don&apos;t
        worry too much about which one you use, as they accomplish the same thing.
