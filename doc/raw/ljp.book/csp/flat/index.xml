      This is a reference to the <quote>flat</quote> interface to &lj;, 
      where <quote>flat</quote> is simply a term describing the raw 
      &http; request sent to a &lj; server.
    </para>
    <para>
      This interface passes simple key/value pairs for each request and response.
      Its advantage is that parsing the server response(s), if you need to do it yourself, is easy.
      As an alternative, there is an <link linkend="ljp.csp.xml-rpc.protocol">&xmlrpc; Interface</link>
      <footnote id="note.xml-rpc">
        <para>
          &xmlrpc; is something most programming languages have a library for.
          Check <ulink url="http://www.xmlrpc.com/directory/1568/implementations" /> to see if there is an
          implementation for your language of choice.
        </para>
      </footnote>This returns the data in a predetermined (nested) format, which is easier to work with directly.
