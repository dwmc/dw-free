<title>Creating &amp; Using Breadcrumbs</title>

<formalpara><title>A definition.</title><para>
Bread crumbs are another method of navigation but instead of linking a user
forward, they link a user back. This is very useful for seeing what a level up is or
tracing your path back through the site. They are implemented into the &lj;
codebase, and tied in to the translation system. You can read more about what
bread crumbs are, and how they work, <ulink url="http://www.welie.com/patterns/showPattern.php?patternID=crumbs">here</ulink>.</para></formalpara>

<formalpara><title>Hierarchy.</title><para>
First, crumbs are organized in a tree. The base of the tree is
&apos;home&apos;, which is the front page. Every crumb has a unique key for
itself and one (only one) parent. Each crumb is also defined as having a
default English title and a link to its page.</para></formalpara>

<formalpara><title>Adding crumbs.</title><para>
In the relevant crumbs definition files (<filename>cgi-bin/crumbs.pl</filename> and <filename>crumbs-local.pl</filename>) you
will find the hashes that define the crumbs. If you want to add a new crumb, you
need to add it to one of these files. Note that crumbs in <filename>crumbs-local.pl</filename> override
crumbs in <filename>crumbs.pl</filename>. Site-specific files, like those from
<literal>ljcom</literal>, <emphasis role="strong">need</emphasis> to have their
crumbs put into <filename>crumbs-local.pl</filename>.</para></formalpara>

<formalpara><title><literal>%LJ::CRUMBS(_LOCAL)</literal> Hash format.</title><para>
<programlisting>&apos;<literal>unique_key</literal>&apos; =&gt; [ &apos;<replaceable>Title of Crumb</replaceable>&apos;, &apos;<replaceable>/some/page.bml</replaceable>&apos;, &apos;<replaceable>my_parent</replaceable>&apos; ]</programlisting></para></formalpara>

<para>
That&apos;s a <emphasis>static crumb</emphasis>. Once you have defined one of
those in the relevant Perl file, you can tell &lj; to display that crumb on a
&bml; page by using this code:

<programlisting><literal>LJ::set_active_crumb</literal>(&apos;<replaceable>unique_key</replaceable>&apos;);</programlisting>

Run that anywhere inside of a &bml; page&apos;s code block.</para>

<para>
If you have a page that does not have a code block, you should insert one in
 the following manner:

<programlisting>&lt;?_code
     return <literal>LJ::set_active_crumb</literal>(&apos;<replaceable>unique_key</replaceable>&apos;);
_code?&gt;</programlisting></para>

<formalpara><title>Example site-specific crumb definition file (<filename>cgi-bin/crumbs-local.pl</filename>)</title><para>
<informalexample><programlisting>#!/usr/bin/perl
#
# Stores all local crumbs and adds to the global <literal>%LJ::CRUMBS</literal> hash

<literal>%LJ::CRUMBS_LOCAL</literal> = (
        &apos;whatis&apos; =&gt; [&apos;What Is YourSite?&apos;, &apos;/site/whatis.bml&apos;, &apos;home&apos;],
        &apos;ljbase&apos; =&gt; [&apos;Base&apos;, "$LJ::SITEROOT/", &apos;&apos;],
        &apos;press&apos; =&gt; [&apos;YourSite&apos;, &apos;/press/&apos;, &apos;whatis&apos;],
	           );
1;</programlisting></informalexample></para></formalpara>

<para>
You can also insert <emphasis>dynamic crumbs</emphasis>. If you wish to have a
crumb title reflect something like <quote>Support Request #3777</quote>, you
will need to use a dynamic crumb. You use these like this:

<programlisting><literal>LJ::set_dynamic_crumb</literal>(BML::ml(&apos;.foo&apos;, { &apos;num&apos; =&gt; 5 }), &apos;parent&apos;);</programlisting>

Notice that we call <literal>BML::ml</literal>. This means that the crumb title
can be pulled from the translation database, so you still have a translated
crumb, but you can still insert in the dynamic data that you want.</para>

<formalpara><title>Placing crumbs into the database.</title><para>
When you edit the crumbs files, you need to put them into the translation
database. This is, as you probably expected, done with <command>bin/upgrading/texttool.pl</command>. Specifically, there is a new
<quote><option>loadcrumbs</option></quote> option as well as a
<quote><option>wipecrumbs</option></quote> option. It is easiest to just run:
<command>bin/upgrading/texttool.pl <option>load</option> en
<replaceable>en_YS</replaceable></command> <footnote id="crumbs_texttool_options"><simpara>The <option>load</option> option
includes <quote>en</quote> by default; <replaceable>en_YS</replaceable> is only needed
if you are using site-specific text and bread crumbs.</simpara></footnote>. If
you use <option>loadcrumbs</option> instead of <option>load</option>, make
sure to also use the <option>makeusable</option> option with
<command>texttool.pl</command>, so the crumbs really show up on your
site.</para></formalpara>
