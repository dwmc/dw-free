<title>Capabilities Classes</title>

<para>
The &apos;caps&apos; column in the <database class="table">&apos;user&apos;</database>
table is a 16 bit mask with a bit on for each capability class the user is a part of.
Each site can define their own capability classes in <filename>etc/ljconfig.pl</filename>.
Then, each capability class can define its own limits for the following things.
The <function>LJ::get_cap()</function> and <function>LJ::get_cap_min()</function> functions
will consider the limits of all the classes the member is a part of and return the max or min limit,
depending on what it&apos;s being used for in the code.
