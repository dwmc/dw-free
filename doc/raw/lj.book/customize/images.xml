    <para>
      &lj; uses a standard set of icons for specific pages that are distributed through the <filename role="directory">htdocs/img</filename> directory.
      The <filename>cgi-bin/LJ/Img.pm</filename> file handles the configuration for these images.
      Each image is configured as an associative array in perl, setup with attributes for each file.
      Text for <sgmltag class="attribute">alt</sgmltag> attributes can be English-stripped, so
      the text is pulled from the language file.
    </para>
  <para>
    <filename>cgi-bin/LJ/Img.pm</filename> is provided.  Don't
    change that.  But go ahead and add a new file,
    <filename>cgi-bin/LJ/ImgLocal.pm</filename> beside it in the same
    format, which <filename>LJ/Img.pm</filename> will find and use.
