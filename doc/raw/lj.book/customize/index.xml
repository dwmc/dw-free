      Unless you&apos;re helping on the &lj; development team,
      you&apos;re probably running the &lj; Server for your own
      purposes and will want to customize its appearance, behavior,
      limits, and other settings to suit your needs.  The following
      chapters cover this.

      More importantly, the chapters tell you how to customize the installation
      in the supported way.  Although you&apos;re welcome to just
      hack random parts up until it&apos;s working how you want
      it to, you&apos;ll run into trouble later when you try to stay in
      sync with the latest &lj; code.

      By following these instructions, your life will be much easier,
      as all our tools assume you are doing things this way.  If you
      end up not being able to change something, post in the
      &ljdevweb; community on &ljcom; and ask for help.
      We&apos;ll either tell you the right way to do it, or add hooks/options
      such that you can.
