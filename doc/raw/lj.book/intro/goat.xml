    So what's the story behind the goat?
  </para>
  <para>
    Back when Brad was living in the dorms and was also still running
    a site named <systemitem class="domainname">FreeVote.com</systemitem> 
    <footnote id="freevote"><simpara>
    Later, FreeVote was run by one of Brad&apos;s friends for a while.</simpara>
    </footnote>
    his roommate Eli and him got bored and decided to make some joke ads to put up
    on <systemitem class="domainname">FreeVote.com</systemitem> to advertise &ljcom;.
  </para>
  <para>
    Those original 8 banners, as much as they sucked, are archived for historical
    reasons at <ulink url="http://www.livejournal.com/site/banners.bml" />.
  </para>
  <para>
    After the first four they had both run out of ideas and one of them just spouted out,
    <quote>&ljcom;&hellip; because goats are cool.</quote>  It made no sense, so it was perfect!
    Then Brad went and found a picture of a goat.  That goat then became the unofficial &lj; mascot.

    So basically, the goat means nothing.  But he&apos;s so damn cool, and
