  <title>The Story Behind &lj;</title>
  <para>
    &ljcom;, a website and online community built around
    personal journals, was started by Brad Fitzpatrick in March of
    1999 for himself and some of his friends. Friends told friends
    and it became a huge success, soon growing bigger than a single
    person could easily handle.</para>
  <para>
    As a result, &lj; soon hired its first paid employee. This meant
    it was worked on on a full-time basis, for the first time.
    A team of volunteers working with &lj;&apos;s original developer,
    and the rest of the development team, transformed &ljcom; into a
    Webby Awards twice-winning site used by people worldwide.</para>
  <para>
    The site is now an open-source software development project, funded by
    its members, assisted by numerous volunteers and developers, and
    overseen by a small paid staff. It has been expanded to allow easy
    creation of journals, weblogs, and even interest-based online
    communities.</para>
    <para>
    Six Apart bought &lj;&apos;s parent company, &dangaweb;, 
    in early 2005. &danga;&apos;s founder, Brad Fitzpatrick, maintained
    links with the project, working as a staff-member at Six Apart
    into 2007. In December 2007 &supweb; bought &lj;, and
    established &ljinc; to run it. Today, &lj; still relies heavily on
    volunteer efforts but also has a growing number of staff members.</para>
